In support of the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service, Information Technology Services provides computing, networking, and information resources to UCLA's students, faculty, and staff.

IT Services provides the UCLA community with access to local, national, and international sources of information in an atmosphere that encourages sharing of information, access to a rich collection of services, and open and free discussion for academic purposes and other University-related uses.

Your Responsibilities

Computers and networks can provide access to resources on and off campus, as well as the ability to communicate with other users worldwide. Such open access is a privilege, and requires that individuals act responsibly. Users must respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.
        
You are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your account. IT Services grants permission to members of the UCLA community to use computing resources by issuing individual computing accounts including UCLA Logon IDs. As a condition of receiving an account, you must observe the following guidelines:
        
* Respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.
* Respect others' rights to the privacy of their programs and data.
* Prevent others from learning your password, thus reducing the possibility of illegal use of your account by unauthorized persons.
* Report suspected unauthorized use of facility resources to the BOL User Relations Office (Kerckhoff Hall, Suite 124) or to abuse@ucla.edu.
* Your UCLA Logon may not be used for: unlawful activities; commercial purposes not under the auspices of the University; or personal financial gain (except as permitted under applicable academic policies).
            
Consequences of Misuse
        
Misuse of computing, networking, or information resources may result in the loss of computing privileges. Additionally, misuse of a computing account will require financial restitution to the University for funds expended and could result in University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action.
        
Users may be held accountable for their conduct under any applicable University or campus policies, procedures, or collective bargaining agreements. Any actions which deter other users from doing their work or which would otherwise be deemed malicious by the University will result in the loss of access to the system and possible University disciplinary action or civil or criminal action.  Unauthorized use of computing resources and use for personal gain constitute theft under California law and will be prosecuted by the University.
        
Complaints alleging misuse of resources will be directed to those responsible for taking appropriate disciplinary action.

Acceptance of Terms

For both your personal benefit and the benefit of others, you must assume responsibility for making the best possible use of your privileges and for not abusing them. All existing laws (federal and state) and University regulations and policies apply, including not only those laws and regulations that are specific to computers and networks, but also those that may apply generally to personal conduct.
