        <p>Mail sent to your @ucla.edu email address has to be forwarded to another email address to be received. By default, email sent to your @ucla.edu email address is forwarded to your Google Apps at UCLA, but you can choose to send it a custom address (i.e. a personal one you already use). You can also just disable your @ucla.edu address - if you do so all email will be returned to the sender.</p>
