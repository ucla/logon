<p>A UCLA Identification Number (UID) is a 9-digit permenant record identifier number. Every student,
  faculty, staff, and contactor have a UID. You can find your UID:</p>

  <li>on your UCLA transcript (current students, alumni).</li>
  <li>on your paycheck stub or online earnings statement (faculty, staff).</li>
</ul>

<p> If you do not remember or cannot find your UID, please bring photo
identification that clearly displays both your full name and date of birth
(Driver's License, Passport, or other government issued ID) to the Bruin
